# Fast Wiki Search

Just a small web app built with React that allows to search articles from Wikipedia, or pick a random article, very fast with immediate language changes. The API calls a list of articles that might be of interest depending on input.

## Installation

Still a pending work so it uses the webpack dev server. After installing dependencies, move to the project directory in the CLI :

npm run build //Initializes a new bundled js file for the project

npm run serv // boots up the webpack server
